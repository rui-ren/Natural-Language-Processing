# Hidden Markov Model

"""
HMM have been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, human gesture recognition for computer vision.
Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis for information retrieval and for word sense disambiguation.

Support library: Pomegranate library.
dataset: universal target

Outline:
# Load dataset for the calculation
# Build Most Frequent Class Tagger to use the baseline
# Build HMM POS tagger and compare to the MFC baseline
